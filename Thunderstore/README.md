# Less Guaranteed Access Nodes

I like Alloyed Collective, but one thing I don't love is how it hijacks the stage 3 teleporter fight every single run, so this changes Access Nodes to only have a chance to spawn, dependent on the stage. By default (but this is configurable), the chances are as follows:

- Scorched Acres: 20%
- Sulfur Pools: 33%
- Rallypoint Delta: 50%
- Iron Alluvium: 75%
- [Fogbound Lagoon](https://thunderstore.io/package/JaceDaDorito/FogboundLagoon/): 33%
- [Remote Village](https://thunderstore.io/package/viliger/RemoteVillage/): 33%
- Repurposed Crater (stage 4): 60%

On average, this gives the Access Node about a 45% chance of spawning on stage 3, slightly less if supported custom stages are installed.

You might be asking though, "wouldn't that just make it annoying to get to Solutional Haunt?" My solution to that is: ***if the Access Node spawn is rejected once, it will always spawn the next time.*** So if it doesn't spawn on stage 3, then if you go to Repurposed Crater, the Access Node will be guaranteed. And if you miss both, it will be guaranteed on the next loop. However, once it _does_ spawn at least once in a run, there are no guaranteed spawns after that, so choose wisely. (The guaranteed portal spawn on Siren's Call is untouched, since that's not tied to Access Nodes.)

Only the host should need this mod. If there are any issues, ping me on Discord (`ssm24`) or open an issue on GitHub. Otherwise, enjoy :D
